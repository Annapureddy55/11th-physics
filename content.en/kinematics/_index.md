Physics is basically an experimental science and rests on two pillars–Experiments and mathematics. Two thousand three hundred years ago the Greek librarian Eratosthenes measured the radius of the Earth. The size of the atom was measured much later, only in the beginning of the 20th century. The central aspect in physics is motion. Motion is found at all levels–from microscopic level (within the atom) to macroscopic and galactic level (planetary system and beyond). In short the entire Universe is governed by various types of motion. The study of various types

of motion is expressed using the language of mathematics.

How do objects move? How fast or slow do they move? For example, when ten athletes run in a race, all of them do not run in the same manner. Their performance cannot be qualitatively recorded by usage of words like ‘fastest’, ‘faster’, ‘average’, ‘slower’ or ‘slowest’. It has to be quantified. Quantifying means assigning numbers to each athlete’s motion. Comparing these numbers, one can analyse how fast or slow each athlete runs when compared to others. In this unit, the basic mathematics needed for analyzing motion in terms of its direction and magnitude is covered.

The concept of rest and motion can be well understood by the following elucidation (Figure 2.1). A person sitting in a moving bus is at rest with respect to a fellow passenger but is in motion with respect to a person outside the bus. The concepts of rest and motion have meaning only with respect to some reference frame. To understand rest or motion we need a convenient fixed reference frame.

**Figure 2.1** Frame of Reference

**Frame of Reference:** If we imagine a coordinate system and the position of an object is described relative to it, then such a coordinate system is called frame of reference.

At any given instant of time, the frame of reference with respect to which the position of the object is described in terms of position coordinates (x, y, z) (i.e., distances of the given position of an object along the x, y, and z–axes.) is called

**2.2**

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics which deals with the motion of objects without taking force into account. The Greek word **_“kinema”_** means **_“motion”._**

It is to be noted that if the _x, y_ and _z_ axes are drawn in anticlockwise direction then the coordinate system is called as “right– handed Cartesian coordinate system”. Though other coordinate systems do exist, in physics we conventionally follow the right–handed coordinate system as shown in Figure 2.3.

**Point mass** To explain the motion of an object which has finite mass, the concept of “point mass” is required and is very useful. Let the mass of any object be assumed to be concentrated at a point. Then this  

idealized mass is called “point mass”. It has no internal structure like shape and size. Mathematically a point mass has finite mass with zero dimension. Even though in reality a point mass does not exist, it often simplifies our calculations. It is to be noted that the term “point mass” is a relative term. It has meaning only with respect to a reference frame and with respect to the kind of motion that we analyse.

**Examples** „ To analyse the motion of Earth with

respect to Sun, Earth can be treated as a point mass. This is because the distance between the Sun and Earth is very large compared to the size of the Earth.

„ If we throw an irregular object like a small stone in the air, to analyse its motion it is simpler to consider the stone as a point mass as it moves in space. The size of the stone is very much smaller than the distance through which it travels.

**Types of motion** In our day‒to‒day life the following kinds of motion are observed:

**a) Linear motion** An object is said to be in linear motion if it moves in a straight line.

**Examples** „ An athlete running on a straight track „ A particle falling vertically downwards

to the Earth.

**b) Circular motion** Circular motion is defined as a motion described by an object traversing a circular path.

**Examples** „ The whirling motion of a stone attached

to a string

„ The motion of a satellite around the Earth

These two circular motions are shown in Figure 2.5

**Figure 2.5** Examples of circular motion

**c) Rotational motion** If any object moves in a rotational motion about an axis, the motion is called ‘rotation’. During rotation every point in the object transverses a circular path about an axis, (except the points located on the axis).

**Examples** „ Rotation of a disc about an axis through

its centre „ Spinning of the Earth about its own axis.

These two rotational motions are shown in Figure 2.6.  

**Figure 2.6** Examples of Rotational motion

**d) Vibratory motion** If an object or particle executes a _to–and– fro motion about a fixed point, it is said to_ be in vibratory motion. This is sometimes also called oscillatory motion.

**Examples** „ Vibration of a string on a guitar „ Movement of a swing

These motions are shown in Figure 2.7

**Figure 2.7 Examples of Vibratory motion**




  

Other types of motion like elliptical motion and helical motion are also possible.

**Motion in One, Two and Three Dimensions** Let the position of a particle in space be expressed in terms of rectangular coordinates x, y and z. When these coordinates change with time, then the particle is said to be in motion. However, it is not necessary that all the three coordinates should together change with time. Even if one or two coordinates change with time, the particle is said to be in motion. Then we have the following classification.

**(i) Motion in one dimension**

_One dimensional motion is the motion of a particle moving along a straight line._

This motion is sometimes known as rectilinear or linear motion.

In this motion, only one of the three rectangular coordinates specifying the position of the object changes with time.

For example, if a car moves from position A to position B along _x_–direction, as shown in Figure 2.8, then a variation in x–coordinate alone is noticed.

**Figure 2.8 Motion of a particle along one dimension**

y

x A B  

**Examples** „ Motion of a train along a straight railway

track. „ An object falling freely under gravity

close to Earth.

**(ii) Motion in two dimensions** _If a particle is moving along a curved_

_path in a plane, then it is said to be in two dimensional motion._

In this motion, two of the three rectangular coordinates specifying the position of object change with time.

For instance, when a particle is moving in the _y – z_ plane, x does not vary, but _y_ and _z_ vary as shown in Figure 2.9

**Figure 2.9 Motion of a particle along two dimensions**

**Examples** „ Motion of a coin on a carrom board. „ An insect crawling over the floor of a

room. **(iii) Motion in three dimensions** _A particle moving in usual three_

_dimensional space has three dimensional motion._

In this motion, all the three coordinates specifying the position of an object change with respect to time. When a particle moves in three dimensions, all the three coordinates _x_, _y_ and _z_ will vary.

**ELEMENTARY CONCEPTS OF VECTOR ALGEBRA**

In physics, some quantities possess only magnitude and some quantities possess both magnitude and direction. To understand these physical quantities, it is very important to know the properties of vectors and scalars.

**Scalar** It is a property which can be described only by magnitude. In physics a number of quantities can be described by scalars.

**Examples** Distance, mass, temperature, speed and energy.

**Vector** It is a quantity which is described by both magnitude and direction. Geometrically a vector is a directed line segment which is shown in Figure 2.10. In physics certain quantities can be described only by vectors.

**Figure 2.10 Geometrical representation of a vector**

**Examples** Force, velocity, displacement, position vector, acceleration, linear momentum and angular momentum.  

## Magnitude of a Vector


The length of a vector is called magnitude of the vector. It is always a positive quantity. Sometimes the magnitude of a vector is also called ‘norm’ of the vector. For a vector



_A_, the magnitude or norm is denoted by



_A_ or simply ‘_A_’ (Figure 2.11).

Magnitude of a vector

**Figure 2.11 Magnitude of a vector**

## Different types of Vectors


1\. **Equal vectors:** Two vectors   _A_ and _B_ are

said to be equal when they have equal magnitude and same direction and represent the same physical quantity (Figure 2.12.).

A

B

**Figure 2.12 Geometrical representation of equal vectors**

(a) **Collinear vectors**: Collinear vectors are those which act along the same line. The angle between them can be 0° or 180°.

**(i) Parallel Vectors**: If two vectors  _A_ and _B_ act in the same direction along the same line or on parallel lines, then the angle between them is 00

(Figure 2.13).

**(ii) Anti–parallel vectors:** Two vectors

  _A_ and _B_ are said to be

anti–parallel when they are in opposite directions along the same line or on parallel lines. Then the angle between them is 1800 (Figure 2.14).

B

AB

**Figure 2.14 Geometrical representation of anti– parallel vectors.**

2\. **Unit vector**: A vector divided by its magnitude is a unit vector. The unit vector for ˆ_A is denoted by A_

 is denoted by ˆ_A is denoted by A_ 

(read as A cap or A hat). It has a magnitude equal to unity or one.

Since, ˆ _AA A_

 

we can write ˆ_A AA_ 

Thus, we can say that the unit vector specifies only the direction of the vector quantity.

3\. Orthogonal unit vectors: Let ˆ,̂ ˆ_i j and k_ be three unit vectors which specify the directions along positive _x_–axis, positive  

_y–_axis and positive _z_–axis respectively. These three unit vectors are directed perpendicular to each other, the angle between any two of them is 90°. ˆ,̂ ˆ_i j and k_ a ˆ_j and k_ are examples of orthogonal vectors.

Two vectors which are perpendicular to each other are called orthogonal vectors as is shown in the Figure 2.15

## Addition of Vectors


Since vectors have both magnitude and direction they cannot be added by the method of ordinary algebra. Thus, vectors can be added geometrically or analytically using certain rules called ‘vector algebra’. In order to find the sum (resultant) of two vectors, which are inclined to each other, we use (i) Triangular law of addition method or (ii) Parallelogram law of vectors.

**Triangular Law of addition method** Let us consider two vectors _A and B_

A HeadTail

**Figure 2.16 Head and tail of vectors**






| ∧ |
|------|------|------|------|
| i |

To find the resultant of the two vectors we apply the triangular law of addition as follows:

Represent the vectors  

_A B_ and by the two adjacent sides of a triangle taken in the same order. Then the resultant is given by the third side of the triangle taken in the reverse order as shown in Figure 2.17.

_R_ = _A+B_

_A_

_B_

_P_

_Q_

_O_

**Figure 2.17 Triangle law of addition**

To explain further, the head of the first vector



_A_ is connected to the tail of the second vector



_B_ . Let θ be the angle between

 

_A B_ and . Then 

_R_ is the resultant vector connecting the tail of the first vector



_A_ to the head of the second vector 

_B_. The magnitude of 

_R_ (resultant) is given geometrically by the length of



_R_ (OQ) and the direction of the resultant vector is the angle between



_R_ and 

_A_ . Thus we write   

_R A B_\= + .

_OQ OP PQ_\= +

**(1) Magnitude of resultant vector** The magnitude and angle of the resultant vector are determined as follows.

From Figure 2.18, consider the triangle ABN, which is obtained by extending the side OA to ON. ABN is a right angled triangle.

## Subtraction of vectors


Since vectors have both magnitude and direction two vectors cannot be subtracted from each other by the method of ordinary algebra. Thus, this subtraction can be done either geometrically or analytically. We shall now discuss subtraction of two vectors geometrically using the Figure 2.19

_A_ and 

_B_ which are inclined to each other at an angle θ, the difference

 

_A B_− is obtained as follows. First obtain

## Vector addition using components


In the previous section we have learnt about addition and subtraction of two vectors using geometric methods. But once we choose a coordinate system, the addition and subtraction of vectors becomes much easier to perform.

the coordinate system. But the geometric way of adding and subtracting two vectors is independent of the coordinate system used.

## Scalar Product of Two Vectors


**Definition** The scalar product (or dot product) of two vectors is defined as the product of the magnitudes of both the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.

Thus if there are two vectors  

_A B_ and having an angle θ between them, then their scalar product is defined as

 

_A B AB_⋅ = cosθ. Here, _A B_ and are magnitudes of

 

_A B_ and .

**Properties** (i) The product quantity

 

_A B_⋅ is always a scalar. It is positive if the angle between the vectors is acute (i.e., θ < 90°) and negative if the angle between them is obtuse (i.e. 90°<θ< 180°).

(ii) The scalar product is commutative, i.e.

   

_A B B A_. .= (iii) The vectors obey distributive law i.e.

      

_A B C A B A C_. . .+( ) = +. . .( ) (iv) The angle between the vectors

θ = cos–1

(v) The scalar product of two vectors will be maximum when cos θ = 1, i.e. θ = 0°, i.e., when the vectors are parallel;

(  

A B⋅ ) max = AB

(vi) The scalar product of two vectors will be minimum, when cos θ = –1, i.e. θ = 180°

(  

A B⋅ ) min = –AB, when the vectors are anti-parallel.

(vii) If two vectors 

_A_ and 

_B_ are perpendicular to each other then their scalar product

 

_A B_⋅ = 0 , because cos 90°=0. Then the vectors



_A_ and 

_B_ are said to be mutually orthogonal.

(viii) The scalar product of a vector with itself is termed as self–dot product and is given by

In physics, the work done by a force 

_F_ to move an object through a small displacement _dr_ is defined as,

_W F dr_\= 

. _W F dr_\= cos θ

The work done is basically a scalar product between the force vector and the displacement vector. Apart from work done, there are other physical quantities which are also defined through scalar products.

In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is perpendicular to the

displacement. Hence, work done by this force is zero.

## The Vector Product of Two Vectors


**Definition** _The vector product or cross product of two vectors is defined as another vector having a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of two vectors and the sine of the angle between them. The direction of the product vector is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors, in accordance with the right hand screw rule or right hand thumb rule_ (Figure 2.22)_._

Thus, if 

A and 

B are two vectors, then their vector product is written as

 

A B× which is a vector

**Properties of vector (cross) product.** (i) The vector product of any two

vectors is always another vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing these two vectors, i.e., orthogonal to both the vectors



A and 

B, even though the vectors



A and 

B may or may not be mutually orthogonal.

(ii) The vector product of two vectors is not commutative, i.e.,

 

B A× But.,  

A B× = –\[  

B A× \] Here it is worthwhile to note that

A B× | = |  

B A× | = AB sin θ i.e., in the case of the product vectors  

A B× and  

B A× , the magnitudes are equal but directions are opposite to each other.

(iii) The vector product of two vectors will have maximum magnitude when sin θ = 1, i.e., θ = 90°

i.e., when the vectors 

_A_ and 

_B_ are orthogonal to each other.

# DISTANCE AND DISPLACEMENT


**Distance** is the actual path length travelled by an object in the given interval of time during the motion. It is a positive scalar quantity.

**Displacement is the difference between** the final and initial positions of the object in a given interval of time. It can also be defined as the shortest distance between these two positions of the object and its direction is from the initial to final position of the object, during the given interval of time**.** It is a vector quantity. Figure 2.26 illustrates the difference between displacement and distance.

**EXAMPLE 2.15**

Assume your school is located 2 km away from your home. In the morning you are going to school and in the evening you come back home. In this entire trip what is the distance travelled and the displacement covered?

**_Solution_**

Home SCHOOL morning 2 km

evening  

The displacement covered is zero. It is because your initial and final positions are the same.

But the distance travelled is 4 km.

**EXAMPLE 2.16**

An athlete covers 3 rounds on a circular track of radius 50 m. Calculate the total distance and displacement travelled by him.

**_Solution_**

R A

The total distance the athlete covered =3x circumference of track

Distance = 3 × ×2 50π _m_ = 300× ×2 50π _m_ _m_ (or) Distance ≈ 300 x 3.14 ≈ 942 _m_

The displacement is zero, since the athlete reaches the same point A after three rounds from where he started.

time “t” the temperature T has a unique value. Mathematically this variation can be represented by the notation ‘T (t)’ and it should be called “temperature as a function of time”. It implies that if the value of ‘t’ is given, then the function “T (t)” will give the value of the temperature at that time‘t’. Similarly, the position of a bus in motion along the x direction can be represented by x(t) and this is called ‘x' as a function of time’. Here ‘x’ denotes the x coordinate.

_Example_ Consider a function f(x) = x2. Sometimes it is also represented as y = x2. Here y is called the dependent variable and x is called independent variable. It means as x changes, y also changes. Once a physical quantity is represented by a function, one can study the variation of the function over time or over the independent variable on which the quantity depends. Calculus is the branch of mathematics used to analyse the change of any quantity.

If a function is represented by y = f(x), then dy/dx represents the derivative of y with respect to x. Mathematically this represents the variation of y with respect to change in x, for various continuous values of x.

Mathematically the derivative dy/dx is defined as follows

_dy dx_

From the above table, the following inferences can be made.

„ As D_x_ tends to zero, D D

_y x_

approaches

the limit given by the number 4.

„ At a point x = 2, the derivative _dy dx_

\= 4.

„ It should also be mentioned here that D → D =_x does not mean that x_0 0 does not ean t at .  

This is because, if we substitute ∆ =_x_ 0, D D

_y x_

becomes indeterminate.

In general, we can obtain the derivative of the function y = x2, as follows:

# INTEGRAL CALCULUS


Integration is an area finding process. For certain geometric shapes we can directly find the area. But for irregular shapes the process of integration is used. Consider for example the areas of a rectangle and an irregularly shaped curve, as shown in Figure 2.29.

The area of the rectangle is simply given by A = length × breadth = (b–a) c

xba

y Area = (b −a)c

f(x) = c

Area = ?

f(x)

**Figure 2.29** Area of rectangular and irregular shape

But to find the area of the irregular shaped curve given by f(x), we divide the area into rectangular strips as shown in the Figure 2.30.

_A f a x f x_≈ ( )D + ( )D1  

The area under the curve is approximately equal to sum of areas of each rectangular strip.

This is given by A _f a x f x x f x x f_≈ ( )D + ( )D + ( )D + (1 2

_x f x x f x x_\+ ( )D + ( )D2 3 .

**Figure 2.30** Area under the curve using rectangular strip

Where _f a_( ) is the value of the function _f x_( ) at x = a, _f x_1( ) is the value of _f x_( ) for x = x1 and so on.

As we increase the number of strips, the area evaluated becomes more accurate. If the area under the curve is divided into N strips, the area under the curve is given by

A= _f x xn n_

_N_

As the number of strips goes to infinity, _N_ →∞, the sum becomes an integral,

A= ( )∫ _a_

_b_

_f x dx_

(Note: As _N_ →∞, ∆ →_x_ 0)

The integration will give the total area under the curve f (x). This is shown in Figure 2.31.
