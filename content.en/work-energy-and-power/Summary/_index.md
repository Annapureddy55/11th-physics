# SUMMARY

1. When a force 
F acting on an object displaces it by W F = = dr
  . , then the work done(W) by the
force is W F = = dr
  . Fdr cosθ.

2. The work done by the variable force is defined by . f
i
F dr 
 

3. Work-kinetic energy theorem: The work done by a force on the object is equal to the
change in its kinetic energy.

4. The kinetic energy can also be defined in terms of momentum which is given by
K E p
m . =
2
2 .

5. The potential energy at a point P is defined as the amount of work required to move
the object from some reference point O to the point P with constant velocity. It is given
by U F dr ext O
P
 
  . . The reference point can be taken as zero potential energy.

6. The gravitational potential energy at a height h is given by U m= gh . When the
elongation or compression is x, the spring potential energy is given by U k = x
1
2
2 .
Here k is spring constant.

7. The work done by a conservative force around the closed path is zero and for a nonconservative force it is not zero. 

8. The gravitational force, spring force and Coulomb force are all conservative but
frictional force is non-conservative.

9. In the conservative force field, the total energy of the object is conserved

10. In the vertical circular motion, the minimum speed required by the mass to complete
the circle is 5gr . Where r , is the radius of the circle.

11. Power is defined as the rate of work done or energy delivered. It is equal to
P W
t = = F v
 

12. The total linear momentum of the system is always conserved for both the elastic
and inelastic collisions. 

13. The kinetic energy of the system is conserved in elastic collisions.

14. The coefficient of restitution = velocity of separation (after collision)/ velocity of approach (before collision)
