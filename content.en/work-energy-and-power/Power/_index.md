## POWER

### Definition of power


Power is a measure of how fast or slow a work is done. Power is defined as the rate of _work done or energy delivered_.

P W t

\=

_Average power The average power (Pav) is defined as the ratio of the total work done to the total time taken._

P total work done total time takenav 

**Instantaneous power** The instantaneous power (Pinst) is defined as the power delivered at an instant (as time interval approaches zero),

P dW dtinst =

### Unit of power

Power is a scalar quantity. Its dimension is \[ML2T‚Äì3\]. The SI unit of power is watt (W), named after the inventor of the steam engine James Watt. One watt is defined as the power _when one joule of work is done in one second_, (1 W = 1 J s‚Äì1).

The higher units are kilowatt(kW), megawatt(MW), and Gigawatt(GW).

1kW = 1000 W = 103 watt 1MW = 106 watt

1GW = 109 watt

For motors, engines and some automobiles an old unit of power still commercially in use which is called as the horse-power (hp). We have a conversion for horse-power (hp) into watt (W) which is,

1 hp = 746 W

All electrical goods come with a definite power rating in watt printed on them. A 100 watt bulb consumes 100 joule of electrical energy in one second. The energy measured in joule in terms of power  

in watt and time in second is written as, 1 J =1 W s. When electrical appliances are put in use for long hours, they consume a large amount of energy. Measuring the electrical energy in a small unit watt. second (W s) leads to handling large numerical values. Hence, electrical energy is measured in the unit called kilowatt hour (kWh).

1 electrical unit = 1 kWh = 1 √ó (103 W) √ó (3600 s)

1 electrical unit = 3600√ó103 W s

1 electrical unit = 3.6√ó106 J

1 kWh = 3.6√ó106 J

Electricity bills are generated in units of kWh for electrical energy consumption. 1 unit of electrical energy is 1 kWh. (**Note**: kWh is unit of energy and not of power.)

**EXAMPLE 4.18**

Calculate the energy consumed in electrical units when a 75 W fan is used for 8 hours daily for one month (30 days).

**_Solution_**

Power, P = 75 W

Time of usage, t = 8 hour √ó 30 days = 240 hours

Electrical energy consumed is the product of power and time of usage.

Electrical energy = power √ó time of usage = P √ó t

**DO YOU KNOW**

Incandescent lamps glow for 1000 hours. CFL lamps glow for 6000 hours. But LED lamps glow for 50000 hrs (almost 25 years at 5.5 hour per day).

**_Solution_**

The vehicle‚Äôs engine has to do work against resistive force and make vechile to move with an acceleration. Therefore, power delivered by the vehicle engine is
