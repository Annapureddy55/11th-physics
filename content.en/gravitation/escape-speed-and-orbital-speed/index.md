# 6.4 ESCAPE SPEED AND ORBITAL SPEED
Hydrogen and helium are the most abundant
elements in the universe but Earth’s atmosphere
consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen. The
following discussion brings forth the reason
why hydrogen and helium are not found in
abundance on the Earth’s atmosphere. When
an object is thrown up with some initial speed
it will reach a certain height after which it
will fall back to Earth. If the same object is
thrown again with a higher speed, it reaches a
greater height than the previous one and falls
back to Earth. This leads to the question of
what should be the speed of an object thrown
vertically up such that it escapes the Earth’s
gravity and would never come back. This
speed is called “Escape speed” and it is defined
as “the minimum speed required for a body to
escape from the earth’s gravitational pull”.
