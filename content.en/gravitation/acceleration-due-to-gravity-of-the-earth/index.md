# 6.3 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY OF THE EARTH

When objects fall on the Earth, the
acceleration of the object is towards the
Earth. From Newton’s second law, an
object is accelerated only under the action
of a force. In the case of Earth, this force is
the gravitational pull of Earth. This force
produces a constant acceleration near the
Earth’s surface in all bodies, irrespective of
their masses. The gravitational force exerted
by Earth on the mass m near the surface of
the Earth is given by
