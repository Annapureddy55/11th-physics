**KINETIC THEORY**

## Introduction


Thermodynamics is basically a macroscopic science. We discussed macroscopic parameters like pressure, temperature and volume of thermodynamical systems in unit 8. In this unit we discuss the microscopic origin of pressure and temperature by considering a thermodynamic system as collection of particles or molecules. Kinetic theory relates pressure and temperature to molecular motion of sample of a gas and it is a bridge between Newtonian mechanics and thermodynamics. The present chapter introduces the kinetic nature of gas molecules.

C THEORY OF GASES

_ost everything crudely; with kinetic theory, one can wer things, but more accurately.”_ \- Eugene Wigner

## Postulates of kinetic theory of gases


Kinetic theory is based on certain assumptions which makes the mathematical treatment simple. None of these assumptions are strictly true yet the model based on these assumptions can be applied to all gases.

1\. All the molecules of a gas are identical, elastic spheres.

2\. The molecules of different gases are different.

3\. The number of molecules in a gas is very large and the average separation between them is larger than size of the gas molecules.

4\. The molecules of a gas are in a state of continuous random motion.

5\. The molecules collide with one another and also with the walls of the container.




  

**9.2**

6\. These collisions are perfectly elastic so that there is no loss of kinetic energy during collisions.

7\. Between two successive collisions, a molecule moves with uniform velocity.

8\. The molecules do not exert any force of attraction or repulsion on each other except during collision. The molecules do not possess any potential energy and the energy is wholly kinetic.

9\. The collisions are instantaneous. The time spent by a molecule in each collision is very small compared to the time elapsed between two consecutive collisions.

10\. These molecules obey Newton’s laws of motion even though they move randomly.

**PRESSURE EXERTED BY A GAS**

## Expression for pressure exerted by a gas


Consider a monoatomic gas of N molecules each having a mass m inside a cubical container of side _l_ as shown in the Figure 9.1 (a).

![Image Alt Text](../kinetic-theory-of-gases/Figure1.png)


**Figure 9.1** (a) Container of gas molecules  

The molecules of the gas are in random motion. They collide with each other and also with the walls of the container. As the collisions are elastic in nature, there is no loss of kinetic energy, but a change in momentum occurs.

The molecules of the gas exert pressure on the walls of the container due to collision on it. During each collision, the molecules impart certain momentum to the wall. Due to transfer of momentum, the walls experience a continuous force. The force experienced per unit area of the walls of the container determines the pressure exerted by the gas. It is essential to determine the total momentum transferred by the molecules in a short interval of time.

A molecule of mass m moving with a velocity \(\vec{v}\)
having components(\(v_x, v_y, v_z\))
 hits the right side wall. Since we have assumed that the collision is elastic, the particle rebounds with same speed and its x-component is reversed. This is shown in the Figure 9.1 (b). The components of velocity of the molecule after collision are (\(-v_x, v_y, v_z\))
.

The x-component of momentum of the molecule before collision = \(m \cdot v_x\)

![Image Alt Text](../kinetic-theory-of-gases/figure2.png)
**Figure 9.1** (b) Collision of a molecule with the wall





  

The x-component of momentum of the molecule after collision = \(-mv_x\)


The change in momentum of the molecule in x direction =Final momentum – initial momentum = \(-mv_x\)
\(-mv_x = -2mv_x\)


According to law of conservation of linear momentum, the change in momentum of the wall = \(2mv_x\)


In x direction, the total momentum of the system before collision is equal to momentum of the molecule

\((mv_x\))since the momentum of the wall is zero. According to the law of conservation of momentum the total momentum of system after the collision must be equal to total momentum of system before collision. The momentum of the molecule (in x direction) after the collision is \(-mv_x\)
 and the momentum of the wall after the collision is \(2mv_x\). So total momentum of the system after the collision is \((2mv_x - mv_x) = mv_x\)
 which is same as the total momentum of the system before collision.

**Note**

The number of molecules hitting the right side wall in a small interval of time \(\Delta t\)is calculated as follows.

The molecules within the distance of \(v_x \Delta t\)
 from the right side wall and moving towards the right will hit the wall in the time interval \(\Delta t\). This is shown in the Figure 9.2. The number of molecules that will hit the right side wall in a time interval \(\Delta t\) is equal to the product of volume \((A v_x \Delta t\))and number density of the molecules (_n_). Here _A_ is area of the wall and _n_ is number of molecules per unit volume \([\frac{N}{V}]\)


 .

We have assumed that the number density is the same throughout the cube.  

Not all the n molecules will move to the right, therefore on an average only half of the n molecules move to the right and the other half moves towards left side.

The number of molecules that hit the right side wall in a time interval 

\= \(\frac{n}{2Av_x \Delta t}\) <br> <br> (9.1)

In the same interval of time \(\Delta t\), the total momentum transferred by the molecules
\(\Delta p = \frac{n}{2} A v_x \Delta t \times 2m v_x = \frac{A v_x^2}{mn \Delta t}\)<br> <br> (9.2)

From Newton’s second law, the change in momentum in a small interval of time gives rise to force.

The force exerted by the molecules on the wall (in magnitude)

\[ F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{nmAv_x^2}{\Delta t} \] <br>(9.3)


Pressure, P = force divided by the area of the wall

\[ P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{nmv_x^2}{x} \]
 (9.4)

Since all the molecules are moving completely in random manner, they do not have same speed. So we can replace the term \(v_x^2\)by the average\(\overline{v_x^2}\) in equation (9.4)

![Image Alt Text](../kinetic-theory-of-gases/image_8.png)
**Figure 9.2** Number of molecules hitting the wall




  

\[ p = nm\overline{v^2x} \]
(9.5)

Since the gas is assumed to move in random direction, it has no preferred direction of motion (the effect of gravity on the molecules is neglected). It implies that the molecule has same average speed in all the

three direction. So, \[ \overline{v_x^2} = \overline{v_y^2} = \overline{v_z^2} \]
. The mean square speed is written as

\[ \overline{v^2} = \overline{v_x^2} +\overline{v_y^2} +\overline{v_z^2} =\overline{3v_x^2} \]

\[\overline{v_x^2}=\frac{1}{3} \overline{v^2}  \]


Using this in equation (9.5), we get

\[ P = \frac{1}{3}nm \overline{v^2} \]


or 

\[ P = \frac{1}{3} \frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{V} \] (9.6)

as [\(n = \frac{N}{V}\)]






The following inference can be made from the above equation. The pressure exerted by the molecules depends on

(i) **Number density** \(n = \frac{N}{V}\)

\= . It implies that if the number density increases then pressure will increase. For example when we pump air inside the cycle tyre or car tyre essentially the number density increases and as a result the pressure increases.

(ii) **Mass of the molecule** Since the pressure arises due to momentum transfer to the wall, larger mass will have larger momentum for a fixed speed. As a result the pressure will increase.

(iii) Mean square speed For a fixed mass if we increase the speed, the average speed will also increase. As a result the pressure will increase.

For simplicity the cubical container is taken into consideration. The above result is true for any shape of the container as the area A does not appear in the final expression (9.6). Hence the pressure exerted by gas  

molecules on the wall is independent of area of the wall (A).

## Kinetic interpretation of temperature


To understand the microscopic origin of temperature in the same way,

Rewrite the equation (9.6)
\[ P = \frac{1}{3}nm \overline{v^2} \]


\[ P = \frac{1}{3} {Nm\overline{v^2} }\]



(9.7)

Comparing the equation (9.7) with ideal gas equation _PV=NkT_,

\[ NkT=\frac{1}{3} {Nm\overline{v^2}} \]

\[ kT=\frac{1}{3} {m\overline{v^2}} \]


 (9.8)

Multiply the above equation by 3/2 on both sides,

2_kT mv_\= (9.9)

R.H.S of the equation (9.9) is called average kinetic energy of a single molecule (_KE_).

The average kinetic energy per molecule

_KE_ = ∈ = 3

2 _kT_ (9.10)

Equation (9.9 ) implies that the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy per molecule of the gas.

Compare this with the definition of temperature studied in lower classes:

Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness!

**Note**

Equation 9.10 is a very important result from kinetic theory of gas. We can infer the following from this equation.






| Pn=as  n |12 |
|------|------|
| mv3N = V  |
  

(i) The average kinetic energy of the molecule is directly proportional to absolute temperature of the gas. The equation (9.9) gives the connection between the macroscopic world (temperature) to microscopic world (motion of molecules).

(ii) The average kinetic energy of each molecule depends only on temperature of the gas not on mass of the molecule. In other words, if the temperature of an ideal gas is measured using thermometer, the average kinetic energy of each molecule can be calculated without seeing the molecule through naked eye.

By multiplying the total number of gas molecules with average kinetic energy of each molecule, the internal energy of the gas is obtained.

By using equation (9.9)

_U NkT_\= 3

2 (9.11)

From equation (9.11), we understand that the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on absolute temperature and is independent of pressure and volume.

**EXAMPLE 9.1**

A football at 27°C has 0.5 mole of air molecules. Calculate the internal energy of air in the ball.

**_Solution_**

The internal energy of ideal gas = 3

2 _NkT_.

The number of air molecules is given in terms of number of moles so, rewrite the expression as follows  

_U RT_\= 3 2

µ

Since _Nk = μR_. Here _μ_ is number of moles.

Gas constant _R_ = 8.31 _J mol k_

Temperature T =273+27=300K

U = 3

2 × 0.5 × 8.31 × 300 = 1869.75_J_

This is approximately equivalent to the kinetic energy of a man of 57 kg running with a speed of 8 m s-1.

## Relation between pressure and mean kinetic energy


From earlier section, the internal energy of the gas is given by

_U NkT_\= 3

2

The above equation can also be written as

_U_ = 3

2 _PV_

since _PV_ = _NkT_

_P_ = 2

_U V_

_u_\= (9.12)

From the equation (9.12), we can state that the pressure of the gas is equal to two thirds of internal energy per unit volume or internal energy density (_u = U_

_V_ ).

Writing pressure in terms of mean kinetic energy density using equation (9.6)

_P nmv v_\= = 1 3

2 2ρ (9.13)

where ρ = _nm_ = _mass density_ (Note n is number density)

Multiply and divide R.H.S of equation (9.13) by 2, we get

_P v_\= 

 



 

2ρ (9.14)

_P KE_\= 2 3




  

From the equation (9.14), pressure is equal to 2/3 of mean kinetic energy per unit volume.

## Some elementary deductions from kinetic theory of gases


**Boyle’s law:**

From equation (9.12), we know that _PV U_\= 2

3

But the internal energy of an ideal gas is equal to N times the average kinetic energy (∈) of each molecule.

_U_ \= _N_∈

For a fixed temperature, the average translational kinetic energy ∈ will remain constant. It implies that

_PV_ \= 2

3 N∈ Thus PV = constant

Therefore, pressure of a given gas is inversely _proportional to its volume provided the temperature remains constant. This is Boyle’s law_.

**Charles’ law:**

From the equation (9.12), we get _PV U_\= 2

3

_For a fixed pressure, the volume of the gas is proportional to internal energy of the gas or average kinetic energy of the gas and the average kinetic energy is directly proportional to absolute temperature. It implies that_

_V_ α _T or V T_

\= _constant_

This is Charles’ law.

**Avogadro’s law:**

This law states that at constant temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules. For two different gases at the same temperature and pressure, according to kinetic theory of gases,  

From equation (9.6)

_P N V m v N_

_V m v_\= =1

where _v_ 1

2 and _v_2 2 are the mean square speed

for two gases and _N_1 and _N_2 are the number of gas molecules in two different gases.

At the same temperature, average kinetic energy per molecule is the same for two gases.

2_m v m v_\= (9.16)

Dividing the equation (9.15) by (9.16) we get _N_1 _\= N_2

This is Avogadro’s law. It is sometimes referred to as Avogadro’s hypothesis or Avogadro’s Principle.

## Root mean square speed (_vrms_)


Root mean square speed (vrms) is defined as the square root of the mean of the square of speeds

of all molecules. It is denoted by _v_rms = _v_2

Equation (9.8) can be re-written as,

mean square speed _v kT m_

2 3= (9.17)

root mean square speed,

_v_rms = 3 1 73

_kT m_

_kT m_

\= . (9.18)

From the equation (9.18) we infer the following (i) rms speed is directly proportional to

square root of the temperature and inversely proportional to square root of mass of the molecule. At a given temperature the molecules of lighter mass move faster on an average than the molecules with heavier masses.




  

3_R M_

3

Example: Lighter molecules like hydrogen and helium have high ‘_vrms_’ than heavier molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen at the same temperature. (ii) Increasing the temperature will

increase the r.m.s speed of molecules

We can also write the _v_rms in terms of gas constant R. Equation (9.18) can be rewritten as follows

_v_rms = 3_N kT N m A_

_A_

Where _N_A is Avogadro number.

Since _N_A_k = R_ and _N_A_m = M_ (molar mass)

The root mean square speed or r.m.s speed

_v_rms = 3_RT M_

(9.19)

The equation (9.6) can also be written in terms of rms speed _P nmv rms_\= 1

3

2

since _v vrms_ 2 2=

Root mean square speed is not the same as average speed. Average speed is 0.92 times of r.m.s speed.

**Note**

Impact of _vrms_ in nature:

1\. **Moon has no atmosphere.** The escape speed of gases on the surface of Moon is much less than the root mean square speeds of gases due to low gravity. Due to this all the gases escape from the surface of the Moon.

2\. **No hydrogen in Earth’s atmosphere**. As the root mean square speed of hydrogen is much greater than that of nitrogen, it easily escapes from the earth’s atmosphere.

In fact, the presence of nonreactive nitrogen instead of highly combustible hydrogen deters many disastrous consequences.  

**EXAMPLE 9.2**

A room contains oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the ratio 3:1. The temperature of the room is 27°C. The molar mass of 02 is 32 g mol-1 and of H2 is 2 g mol-1. The value of gas constant R is 8.32 J mol-1 K-1

**_Calculate_**

(a) rms speed of oxygen and hydrogen molecule

(b) Average kinetic energy per oxygen molecule and per hydrogen molecule

(c) Ratio of average kinetic energy of oxygen molecules and hydrogen molecules

**_Solution_**

Note that the rms speed is inversely proportional to M and the molar mass of oxygen is 16 times higher than molar mass of hydrogen. It implies that the rms speed of hydrogen is 4 times greater than rms speed of oxygen at the same temperature. 1934 ≈ 4 .

(b) The average kinetic energy per

only on absolute temperature of the gas and is independent of the nature of molecules. Since both the gas molecules are at the same temperature, they have the same average kinetic energy per molecule. _k_ is Boltzmaan constant.

where _NH_\- number of hydrogen molecules in the room. It is given that the number of oxygen molecules is 3 times more than number of hydrogen molecules in the room. So the ratio of average kinetic energy of oxygen molecules with average kinetic energy of hydrogen molecules is 3:1.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution function


In a classroom, the air molecules are moving in random directions. The speed of each molecule is not the same even though macroscopic parameters like temperature and pressure are fixed. Each molecule collides with every other molecule and they exchange their speed. In the previous section  

we calculated the rms speed of each molecule and not the speed of each molecule which is rather difficult. In this scenario we can find the number of gas molecules that move with the speed of 5 m s−1 to 10 m s−1 or 10 m s−1to 15 m s−1 etc. In general our interest is to find how many gas molecules have the range of speed from v to v + dv. This is given by Maxwell’s speed distribution function.

The exact integration is beyond the scope of the book. But we can infer the behavior of gas molecules from the graph.

(i) The area under the graph will give the total number of gas molecules in the system

(ii) Figure 9.4 shows the speed distribution graph for two different temperatures. As temperature increases, the peak of the curve is shifted to the right. It implies that the average speed of each molecule will increase. But the area under each graph is same since it represents the total number of gas molecules.

**9.3**

Interestingly once the gas molecule attains equilibrium, the number of molecules in the given range

of speeds are fixed. For example if a molecule initially moving with speed 12 m s-1, collides with some other molecule and changes its speed to 9 m s-1, then the other molecule initially moving with different speed reaches the speed 12 m s-1 due to another collision. So in general once the gas molecules attain equilibrium, the number of molecules that lie in the range of v to v+dv is always fixed.

**DEGREES OF FREEDOM**

## Definition


_The minimum number of independent coordinates needed to specify the position and configuration of a thermo-dynamical system in space is called the degree of freedom of the system._

50 60 1_to ms_− )

o different temperatures




  

**Example:** 1\. A free particle moving along x-axis

needs only one coordinate to specify it completely. So its degree of freedom is one.

2\. Similarly a particle moving over a plane has two degrees of freedom.

3\. A particle moving in space has three degrees of freedom.

Suppose if we have N number of gas molecules in the container, then the total number of degrees of freedom is f = 3N.

But, if the system has _q_ number of constraints (restrictions in motion) then the degrees of freedom decreases and it is equal to _f = 3N-q_ where N is the number of particles.

## Monoatomic molecule


A monoatomic molecule by virtue of its nature has only three translational degrees of freedom.

Therefore f = 3

**Example:** Helium, Neon, Argon

## Diatomic molecule


There are two cases.

**1\. At Normal temperature**

A molecule of a diatomic gas consists of two atoms bound to each other by a force of attraction. Physically the molecule can be regarded as a system of two point masses fixed at the ends of a massless elastic spring.

The center of mass lies in the center of the diatomic molecule. So, the motion of the center of mass requires three translational degrees of freedom (figure 9.5 a). In addition, the diatomic molecule can rotate  

about three mutually perpendicular axes (figure 9.5 b). But the moment of inertia about its own axis of rotation is negligible (about y axis in the figure 9.5). Therefore, it has only two rotational degrees of freedom (one rotation is about Z axis and another rotation is about X axis). Therefore totally there are five degrees of freedom.

_f_ \= 5

**2\. At High Temperature**

At a very high temperature such as 5000 K, the diatomic molecules possess additional

two degrees of freedom due to vibrational motion\[one due to kinetic energy of vibration and the other is due to potential energy\] (Figure 9.5c). So totally there are seven degrees of freedom.

_f_ \= 7

**Examples:** Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen.

## Triatomic molecules


There are two cases.

**Linear triatomic molecule**

In this type, two atoms lie on either side of the central atom as shown in the Figure 9.6

**Figure 9.6** A linear triatomic molecule.

OO C

Linear triatomic molecule has three translational degrees of freedom. It has two rotational degrees of freedom because it is similar to diatomic molecule except there is an additional atom at the center. At normal temperature, linear triatomic molecule will have five degrees of freedom. At high temperature it has two additional vibrational degrees of freedom. So a linear triatomic molecule has seven degrees of freedom.

**Example:** Carbon dioxide.  

**9.4**

**Non-linear triatomic molecule**

In this case, the three atoms lie at the vertices of a triangle as shown in the Figure 9.7

**Figure 9.7** A non-linear triatomic molecule

O

It has three translational degrees of freedom and three rotational degrees of freedom about three mutually orthogonal axes. The total degrees of freedom, f = 6

**Example:** Water, Sulphurdioxide.

## Application of law of equipartition energy in specific heat of a gas


Meyer’s relation _CP_ − _CV_ \= _R_ connects the two specific heats for one mole of an ideal gas.

Equipartition law of energy is used to calculate the value of _CP_ − _CV_ and the ratio

between them γ = _C C P_

**MEAN FREE PATH**

Usually the average speed of gas molecules is several hundred meters per second even at room temperature (27°C). Odour from an open perfume bottle takes some time to reach us even if we are closer to the room. The time delay is because the odour of the molecules cannot travel straight to us as it undergoes a lot of collisions with the nearby air molecules and moves in a zigzag path. This average distance _travelled by the molecule between two successive collisions is called mean free path (_λ_). We can calculate the mean free path based on kinetic theory._

**Expression for mean free path** We know from postulates of kinetic theory that the molecules of a gas are in random motion and they collide with each other. Between two successive collisions, a molecule




  

moves along a straight path with uniform velocity. This path is called mean free path.

Consider a system of molecules each with diameter d. Let n be the number of molecules per unit volume.

Assume that only one molecule is in motion and all others are at rest as shown in the Figure 9.8

**hit**

**Collision Diameter**

**Figure 9.8** Mean free path

If a molecule moves with average speed _v_ in a time t, the distance travelled is _vt_. In this time t, consider the molecule to move in an imaginary cylinder of volume π_d_2_vt._ It collides with any molecule whose center is within this cylinder. Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of molecules in the volume of the imaginary cylinder. It is equal to π_d_2_vtn._ The total path length divided by the number of collisions in time t is the mean free path.

Mean free path, λ = _distance travelled_

_Number of collisions_

Though we have assumed that only one molecule is moving at a time and other molecules are at rest, in actual practice all the molecules are in random motion. So the average relative speed of one molecule with respect to other molecules has to be taken into account. After some detailed calculations (you will learn in higher classes) the correct expression for mean free path  

∴ =λ π

1 2 2_n d_ (9.26)

The equation (9.26) implies that the mean free path is inversely proportional to number density. When the number density increases the molecular collisions increases so it decreases the distance travelled by the molecule before collisions.

Case1: Rearranging the equation (9.26) using ‘m’ (mass of the molecule)

∴ =λ

π _m d mn_2 2

But mn=mass per unit volume = _ρ_ (density of the gas)

∴ =λ π ρ _m_

Also we know that PV = NkT

∴ =_n P_

Substituting n= ∴ _P kT_

in equation (9.26), we get

λ π

\= _kT_

_d P_2 2 (9.28)

The equation (9.28) implies the following

1\. Mean free path increases with increasing temperature. As the temperature increases, the average speed of each molecule will increase. It is the reason why the smell of hot sizzling food reaches several meter away than smell of cold food.

2\. Mean free path increases with decreasing pressure of the gas and diameter of the gas molecules.

**BROWNIAN MOTION**

In 1827, Robert Brown, a botanist reported that grains of pollen suspended in a liquid moves randomly from one place to other. The random (Zig - Zag path) motion of pollen suspended in a liquid is called Brownian motion. In fact we can observe the dust particle in water moving in random directions. This discovery puzzled scientists for long time. There were a lot of explanations for pollen or dust to move in random directions but none of these explanations were found adequate. After a systematic study, Wiener and Gouy  

proposed that Brownian motion is due to the bombardment of suspended particles by molecules of the surrounding fluid. But during 19th century people did not accept that every matter is made up of small atoms or molecules. In the year 1905, Einstein gave systematic theory of Brownian motion based on kinetic theory and he deduced the average size of molecules.

According to kinetic theory, any particle suspended in a liquid or gas is continuously bombarded from all the directions so that the mean free path is almost negligible. This leads to the motion of the particles in a random and zig–zag manner as shown in Figure 9.9. But when we put our hand in water it causes no random motion because the mass of our hand is so large that the momentum transferred by the molecular collision is not enough to move our hand.
