in x direction is 1

_According to kinetic theory, the average kinetic energy of system of molecules in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is uniformly distributed to all degrees of freedom (x or y or_




  

_z directions of motion) so that each degree of freedom will get_ 1

2 _kT of energy. This is called_

_law of equipartition of energy._

## Application of law of equipartition energy in specific heat of a gas


Meyer’s relation _CP_ − _CV_ \= _R_ connects the two specific heats for one mole of an ideal gas.

Equipartition law of energy is used to calculate the value of _CP_ − _CV_ and the ratio

between them γ = _C C P_

_V_

. Here γ is called

adiabatic exponent.
